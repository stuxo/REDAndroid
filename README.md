# REDAndroid

## An android app for Redacted
This app includes most site features, but some are still in progress

The app may work with a default setup of Gazelle, however some changes have been made to the api to support certain features. These should not be breaking, or easy to remove/update. Just change the url to point to your site and enjoy.
